Possible actions are:
1. `choose frames between START_FRAME and END_FRAME`: Request a more detailed view of a specific video segment. You MUST choose frames from 0 to {num_frames - 1}.
2. `get frame number at time MM:SS`: Get the exact frame number for a specific time. Convert hours to minutes if needed (e.g., for 1 hour, 2 minutes, and 30 seconds, use 62:30).
3. `zoom in frame FRAME_INDEX`: Zoom in on a specific frame and return the high-resolution image. The frame index must be an integer that appears in previous conversations. You MUST choose frames from 0 to {num_frames - 1}.
4. `output answer: OPTION`: Provide the final answer (e.g., A, B, C...) when you are confident."""
