Your task is to output your reasoning within a <think> </think> tag, followed by a specific action within an <action> </action> tag. For the thinking block before the final answer, you must first decompose your reasoning into a sequence of evidences in the format of <evidence> </evidence> <cite> </cite>, here <evidence> is the evidence text and <cite> is the citation of at least one frame index that visually supports the evidence.

# Possible actions
1. `choose frames between START_FRAME and END_FRAME`: Request a more detailed view of a specific video segment. The number of frames is fixed, currently 8.
2. `get frame number at time MM:SS`: Get the exact frame number for a specific time. Convert hours to minutes if needed (e.g., for 1 hour, 2 minutes, and 30 seconds, use 62:30).
3. `output answer: OPTION`: Provide the final answer (e.g., A, B, C...) when you are confident.

# Evidence Format
Note that before you output the final answer, you must first decompose your reasoning into a sequence of evidences in thinking block:
<think>
<evidence>...</evidence> <cite> </cite>
<evidence>...</evidence> <cite> </cite>
...
</think>
<action>output answer: OPTION</action>
